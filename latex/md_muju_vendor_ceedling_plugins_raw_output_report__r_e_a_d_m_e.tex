\subsection*{Overview}

The raw-\/output-\/report allows you to capture all the output from the called tools in a single document, so you can trace back through it later. This is useful for debugging... but can eat through memory quickly if left running.

\subsection*{Setup}

Enable the plugin in your project.\+yml by adding {\ttfamily raw\+\_\+output\+\_\+report} to the list of enabled plugins.


\begin{DoxyCode}
:plugins:
  :enabled:
    - raw\_output\_report
\end{DoxyCode}
