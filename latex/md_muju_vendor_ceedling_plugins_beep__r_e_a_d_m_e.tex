This is a simple plugin that just beeps at the end of a build and/or test sequence. Are you getting too distracted surfing the internet, chatting with coworkers, or swordfighting while it\textquotesingle{}s building or testing? The friendly beep will let you know it\textquotesingle{}s time to pay attention again.

This plugin has very few configuration options. At this time it can beep on completion of a task and/or on an error condition. For each of these, you can configure the method that it should beep.


\begin{DoxyCode}
:tools:
  :beep\_on\_done: :bell
  :beep\_on\_error: :bell
\end{DoxyCode}


Each of these have the following options\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \+:bell -\/ this option uses the A\+S\+C\+II bell character out stdout
\item \+:speaker\+\_\+test -\/ this uses the linux speaker-\/test command if installed
\end{DoxyItemize}

Very likely, we\textquotesingle{}ll be adding to this list if people find this to be useful.
