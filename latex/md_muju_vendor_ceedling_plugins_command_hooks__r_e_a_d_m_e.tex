Plugin for easily calling command line tools at various points in the build process

Define any of these sections in \+:tools\+: to provide additional hooks to be called on demand\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
:pre\_mock\_generate
:post\_mock\_generate
:pre\_runner\_generate
:post\_runner\_generate
:pre\_compile\_execute
:post\_compile\_execute
:pre\_link\_execute
:post\_link\_execute
:pre\_test\_fixture\_execute
:pre\_test
:post\_test
:pre\_release
:post\_release
:pre\_build
:post\_build
\end{DoxyCode}


Each of these tools can support an \+:executable string and an \+:arguments list, like so\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
:tools:
  :post\_link\_execute:
    :executable: objcopy.exe
    :arguments:
      - $\{1\} #This is replaced with the executable name
      - output.srec
      - --strip-all
\end{DoxyCode}


You may also specify an array of executables to be called in a particular place, like so\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
:tools:
  :post\_test:
    -  :executable: echo
       :arguments: "$\{1\} was glorious!"
    -  :executable: echo
       :arguments:
         - it kinda made me cry a little.
         - you?
\end{DoxyCode}


Please note that it varies which arguments are being parsed down to the hooks. For now see {\ttfamily command\+\_\+hooks.\+rb} to figure out which suits you best. Happy Tweaking!
