\subsection*{Overview}

The junit\+\_\+tests\+\_\+report plugin creates an X\+ML file of test results in J\+Unit format, which is handy for Continuous Integration build servers or as input into other reporting tools. The X\+ML file is output to the appropriate {\ttfamily $<$build\+\_\+root$>$/artifacts/} directory (e.\+g. {\ttfamily artifacts/test/} for test tasks, {\ttfamily artifacts/gcov/} for gcov, or {\ttfamily artifacts/bullseye/} for bullseye runs).

\subsection*{Setup}

Enable the plugin in your project.\+yml by adding {\ttfamily junit\+\_\+tests\+\_\+report} to the list of enabled plugins.


\begin{DoxyCode}
:plugins:
  :enabled:
    - junit\_tests\_report
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Configuration}

Optionally configure the output / artifact filename in your project.\+yml with the {\ttfamily artifact\+\_\+filename} configuration option. The default filename is {\ttfamily report.\+xml}.

You can also configure the path that this artifact is stored. This can be done by setting {\ttfamily path}. The default is that it will be placed in a subfolder under the {\ttfamily build} directory.


\begin{DoxyCode}
:junit\_tests\_report:
  :artifact\_filename: report\_junit.xml
\end{DoxyCode}
