\subsection*{Overview}

The colour\+\_\+report replaces the normal ceedling \char`\"{}pretty\char`\"{} output with a colorized variant, in order to make the results easier to read from a standard command line. This is very useful on developer machines, but can occasionally cause problems with parsing on CI servers.

\subsection*{Setup}

Enable the plugin in your project.\+yml by adding {\ttfamily colour\+\_\+report} to the list of enabled plugins.


\begin{DoxyCode}
:plugins:
  :enabled:
    - colour\_report
\end{DoxyCode}
